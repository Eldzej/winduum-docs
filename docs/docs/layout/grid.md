# Grid

It's recommended to use following TailwindCSS approaches to shape your layout

* [Grid](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/grid-template-columns)
* [Flex](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex)
* [Gap](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/gap)

This should cover most of use cases, but in some cases the classic pre-grid `col` approach can be usefully too.
